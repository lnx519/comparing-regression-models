# Comparing Regression Models for Airbnb Data

This project compares the performance of different regression algorithms on Airbnb listing data using key evaluation metrics.

## 🧠 Objective
To evaluate and compare multiple regression models for predicting continuous Airbnb review scores, and identify which model performs best using RMSE and R² metrics.

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## 📊 Models Compared
- Linear Regression ✅  
- Random Forest Regression ✅  
- Gradient Boosting Regression ✅  

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) ✅  
- R² Score ✅  

## 📁 Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `comparing-regression-models.ipynb` | Main notebook comparing ML regressors |
| `airbnbData_train.csv` | Airbnb dataset used for regression tasks |

## 🏁 Results
After training and evaluating each model, the one with the best combination of low RMSE and high R² was selected. Visual comparisons helped highlight performance differences across models.
